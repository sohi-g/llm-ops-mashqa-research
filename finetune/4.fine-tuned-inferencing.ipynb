      "Lifting objects improperly is a common cause of back pain. Here are some tips on how to lift objects safely and prevent injury. 1. Warm up before lifting: Before you start lifting, do some light exercise or stretching to get your muscles ready for the task. 2. Get a firm grip: Hold the object as close to your body as possible with your palms facing the object. 3. Keep your body aligned: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and bend your knees slightly. Keep your back straight and your head up. 4. Lift slowly: Slowly lift the object straight up and over your head, keeping your arms close to your body. 5. Hold the object securely: Keep the object as close to your body as possible and avoid twisting your spine. 6. Take breaks: Don't lift objects that are too heavy for you. If you do, take frequent breaks and rest. 7. Keep your work area clean: Keep your work area clean and free of clutter. This will make it easier to lift objects and reduce the risk of injury. 8. Use proper lifting equipment: If you need to lift heavy objects, use proper lifting equipment such as a hand truck, dolly, or pallet jack. 9. Get help: Don't be afraid to ask for help. If you need it, ask a coworker or supervisor for assistance. 10. Seek medical attention: If you have back pain that doesn't go away, see a doctor. They may recommend physical therapy or other treatments to help you manage your pain.\n",

      "### Reasoning:\n",
      "Antibiotics are powerful drugs that can fight off bacterial infections. But they don't work on viruses. If you take antibiotics for a viral infection, you're wasting your money and the drug. And if you stop taking antibiotics before the full course is done, the bacteria can come back and multiply. That's why it's important to follow your doctor's directions and take the full course of antibiotics. You should also take them as directed. That means taking the pills at the right times and in the right way. If you don't take them as directed, the bacteria may not die. And if you take too many antibiotics, the bacteria can become resistant to the drugs. That means they can fight off the antibiotics and come back to cause infections. So be smart with antibiotics. Take them as directed. Finish the full course. And don't take them for viral infections.\n",
